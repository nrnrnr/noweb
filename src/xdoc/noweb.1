.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Noweb
is a literate-programming tool like
.I FunnelWEB
or 
.IR nuweb ,
only simpler.
A 
.I noweb
file contains program source code interleaved with documentation.
When 
.I noweb
is invoked, it writes the program source code 
to the output files mentioned in the noweb file, and it writes a 
.I TeX
file for typeset documentation.
.PP
The 
.IR noweb (1)
command is for people who don't like reading man pages or who are switching from 
.IR nuweb .
To get the most out of
.IR noweb ,
use
.IR notangle (1)
and 
.IR noweave (1)
instead.
.SH FORMAT OF NOWEB FILES
A 
.I noweb 
file is a sequence of
.IR chunks ,
which may appear in any order.
A chunk may contain code or documentation.
Documentation chunks begin with a line that starts with an at sign (@) 
followed by a space or newline.
They have no names.
Code chunks begin with
.br
<<\fIchunk name\fP>>=
.br
on a line by itself.
The double left angle bracket (<<) must be in the first column.
Chunks are terminated by the beginning of another chunk, or by end of file.
If the first line in the file does not mark the beginning of a
chunk, it is assumed to be the first line of a documentation chunk.
.PP
Documentation chunks contain text that is copied verbatim to the
.I TeX
file (except for quoted code).
.I noweb
works with \fILaTeX\fP; the first documentation chunk must contain
a 
.I LaTeX
.B "\\\\documentclass"
command, it must contain
.B "\\\\usepackage{noweb}"
in the preamble, and finally
it must also contain a 
.I LaTeX
.B "\\\\begin{document}"
command.
.PP
Code chunks contain program source code and references to other code
chunks.
Several code chunks may have the same name;
.I noweb
concatenates their definitions to produce a single chunk, just as
other literate-programming tools do.
.I noweb
looks for chunks that are defined but not used in the source file.
If the name of such a chunk contains no spaces, the chunk is
an ``output file;''
.I noweb
expands it and writes the result onto the file of the same name.
A code-chunk definition is like a macro definition;
it contains references to other chunks, which are 
themselves expanded, and so on.
\fInoweb\fP's output is readable; it preserves the indentation of expanded
chunks with respect to the chunks in which they appear.
.PP
If a star (\fB*\fP) is appended to the name of an output file,
.I noweb
includes line-number information as specified by the \fB\-L\fP\fIformat\fP
option (or for C if no \fB\-L\fP\fIformat\fP option is given).
The name itself may not contain shell metacharacters.
.PP
Code may be quoted within documentation
chunks by placing double square brackets
(\fB[[\fI...\fB]]\fR) around it.
These double square brackets are used to
give the code special typographic treatment in the
.I TeX
file.
If quoted code ends with three or more square brackets,
.I noweb
chooses the rightmost pair, so that, for example, \fB[[a[i]]]\fR is
parsed correctly.
.PP
In code, noweb treats unpaired
double left or right angle brackets as literal \fB<<\fP and \fB>>\fP.  
To force any
such brackets, even paired brackets or brackets in documentation, 
to be treated as literal, use a preceding at sign (e.g. \fB@<<\fP).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-t
Suppress generation of a 
.I TeX
file.
.TP
.B \-o
Suppress generation of output files.
.TP
.B \-L\fIformat\fR
Use 
.I format
to format line-number information for starred output files.
(If the option is omitted, a format suitable for C is used.)
.I format
is as defined by 
.IR notangle (1);
.TP
.B "\-markup \fIparser\fP"
Use 
.I parser
to parse the input file.
Enables use of noweb tools on files in other formats;
for example, the 
.B numarkup
parser understands
.IR nuweb (1)
format.
See 
.IR nowebfilters (7)
for more information.
For experts only.
.SH BUGS
.PP
Ignoring unused chunks whose names contain spaces
sometimes causes problems, especially in the case when a chunk has
multiple definitions and one is misspelled;
the misspelled definition will be silently ignored.
.IR noroots (1)
can be used as a sanity checker to catch this sort of mistake.
.PP
.I noweb
is intended for users who don't want the power or the complexity of 
command-line options.
More sophisticated users should avoid
.I noweb
and use 
.I noweave 
and 
.I notangle
instead.
If the design were better, we could all use the same commands.
.PP
.I noweb
requires the new version of
.IR awk ,
assumed to be called
.IR nawk .
DEC
.I nawk
has a bug in that that causes problems with braces in
.I TeX
output.
GNU 
.I gawk
is reported to work.
.PP
The default
.I LaTeX
pagestyles don't set the width of the boxes containing headers and footers.
Since 
.I noweb
code paragraphs are extra wide, this 
.I LaTeX
bug sometimes results in extra-wide headers and footers.
The remedy is to redefine the relevant 
.B ps@*
commands;
.B ps@noweb
in 
.B noweb.sty
can be used as an example.
