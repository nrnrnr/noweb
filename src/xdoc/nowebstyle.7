.TH NOWEB 7 "local 10/40/2008"
.SH NAME
nowebstyle \- \fILaTeX\fP package for \fInoweb\fP
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "\\\\usepackage{noweb}"
.SH DESCRIPTION
When 
.I noweave
generates code for 
.IR LaTeX ,
the
.B noweb
package is required.
In addition to the necessary arcana, it
defines a 
.B webcode
environment in which you can place fragments of 
code, and in which
only backslash and curly braces have their special meanings;
all other characters are taken literally.
It also defines a
.B noweb
pagestyle.
Finally, it defines a
.B "\\\\noweboptions{...}"
command that can be used to tinker with the appearance of the output.
Options are separated by commas and include:
.TP
.B margintag
Put the sub-page number (tag) of each code-chunk definition in the
left margin. (Default)
.TP
.B nomargintag
Don't use margin tags.
.TP
.B shift
Shift text to the left so that long code lines won't extend
off the right-hand side of the page.
.TP
.B smallcode
Set code in 
.I LaTeX
.B "\\\\small"
font instead of 
.B "\\\\normalsize."
Similar options exist for all the 
.I LaTeX
size-changing commands.
.TP
.B longxref, shortxref, noxref
Choose a style for chunk cross-reference.
Long style uses  small paragraphs after each chunk, as in Knuth.
Short style uses symbols on the definition line, as in Hanson.
.B noxref
provides no chunk cross-reference. 
Defaults to 
.B shortxref.
.TP
.B alphasubpage, numsubpage, nosubpage
Number chunks by the number of the page on which they appear,
followed by an alphabetic (numeric, not used) ``sub-page'' indicator.
Defaults to 
.B alphasubpage.
.B nosubpage
implies
.B nomargintag.
.TP
.B webnumbering
Number chunks consecutively, in 
.I WEB
style, instead of using sub-page numbers.
.TP
.B subscriptidents, nosubscriptidents, hyperidents, nohyperidents
Controls subscripting of identifiers in code, including quoted code.
Selecting
.B subscriptidents
means an identifier appearing in a code chunk (or in quoted code
within a documentation 
chunk) will be subscripted with the chunk number of its definition.
.B hyperidents
means such identifiers will be hyperlinked to their definitions,
provided of course that a hypertext package like
.B hyperref
is loaded.
.B nosubscriptidents
and 
.B nohyperidents
are equivalent, and they turn off such markings.
The default is
.B hyperidents.
.TP
.B subscriptquotedidents, nosubscriptquotedidents, hyperquotedidents, nohyperquotedidents
Controls linking of identifiers as above, but applies only to uses of
identifiers
in quoted code.
.TP
.B hideunuseddefs
Omit defined but unused identifiers from
the local identifier cross-reference (Preston Briggs).
.TP
.B noidentxref
Omit the local identifier cross-reference which follows each code chunk.
.TP
.B externalindex
Use an index generated with 
.I noindex(1)
(q.v.).
.TP
.B longchunks
When expanding 
.B "\\\\nowebchunks,"
show page numbers of definitions and uses of each chunk.
.TP
.B english, french, german, portuges, icelandic
Write cross-reference information in the language specified.
Defaults to 
.B english.
.SH CONTROL SEQUENCES
The noweb package describes a gazillion special control sequences.
Only a few are listed here.
.PP \" .TP will not work with the backslashes on the next line. Period.
\fB\\nextchunklabel{l}\fP
.RS
Associates label \fBl\fP
with the sub-page reference of the next code chunk.
Can be used in for concise chunk cross-reference with, e.g.,
\fBchunk~\\subpageref{l}\fP.
.RE
.PP
.B "\\\\nwanchorto{URL}{anchor text}"
.RS
Creates a link to the given URL with the given anchor text.
Implemented in 
.I latex(1)
using footnotes, but 
.I sl2h(1)
translates this to
.B "<a href=URL>anchor text</a>"
.RE
.PP
.B "\\\\nwanchorname{name}{anchor text}"
.RS
Creates an anchor point for a hyperlink.
Implemented in 
.I latex(1)
using 
.B "\\\\label",
but
.I sl2h(1)
translates this to
.B "<a name=name>anchor text</a>"
.RE
.PP
.B "\\\\ifhtml ... \\\\fi"
.RS
Text between
.B "\\\\ifhtml"
and
.B "\\\\fi"
is ignored by 
.I latex(1),
but 
.I sl2h(1)
and the 
.I l2h 
noweb filter translate the text into HTML.
.RE
.SH COMPATIBILITY
For compatibility with plain 
.IR TeX , 
.I noweb
continues to use the old-style font commands
.B "\\\\tt"
and so on.
When used with the KOMA scripts (document classes 
.BR scrartcl , 
.BR scrreprt , 
and
.BR scrbook ),
.I noweb
needs the document-class option
.BR enabledeprecatedfontcommands .
