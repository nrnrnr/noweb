\begin{abstract}
When it was introduced, literate programming meant {\tt WEB}.
Desire to use {\tt WEB} with languages other than Pascal led to the
implementation of many versions.
{\tt WEB} is complex, and the difficulty of using {\tt WEB} creates
an artificial barrier to
experimentation with literate programming.
 {\tt noweb} provides much of the functionality of
{\tt WEB}, with a fraction of the complexity.
{\tt noweb} is independent of the target programming language, and its
formatter-dependent part is less than 40~lines.
{\tt noweb} is extensible, because it uses two
representations of programs: one easily edited by authors and one
easily manipulated by tools.

This paper explains how to use the {\tt noweb} tools and gives
examples of their use.
It sketches the implementation of the tools and describes how new
tools are added to the set.
Because 
{\tt WEB} and {\tt noweb} overlap, but each does some things that the
other cannot,
this paper enumerates the differences.

\section{Introduction}
When literate programming was
introduced, it was synonymous with {\tt WEB}, a tool
for writing literate Pascal programs~\cite[Chapter~4]{knuth:literate:book}.
The idea attracted attention; several examples of literate
programs were published, and a special forum was created to discuss literate
programming~%
\cite{denning:announcing,gries:pearls,knuth:literate:book,thimbleby:review}.
{\tt WEB} was  adapted to programming languages other than
Pascal~\cite{guntermann:cweb,levy:cweb,ramsey:building,sewell:mangle,thimbleby:cweb}.
%
With experience, many {\tt WEB} users became dissatisfied~\cite{ramsey:literate}. 
Some found {\tt WEB} not worth the trouble, as did
one author of the program appearing in Appendix~C
of Reference~\refno{sewell:weaving}.
Others built their own systems for literate
 programming.  % ~\cite{hamilton:expanding,cvw:loom}. 
The literate-programming forum was dropped, on the grounds that
literate programming had become the province of those who could build
their own tools~\cite{cvw:assessment}.

{\tt WEB}  programmers
 interleave source code and descriptive text in a single document.
When using {\tt WEB}, a programmer divides the source code into
{\em modules}.
Each module has a documentation part and a code part, and
modules may be written in any order.
The programmer is encouraged to choose an order that helps explain the program.
The code parts are like macro definitions;  they have names, and they contain
both code and references to other modules.
A {\tt WEB} file represents a single program;
{\tt TANGLE}  extracts that program from the {\tt WEB} source. 
One special module has a code part with no name, and {\tt TANGLE}
expands the code part of that module to extract the program.
{\tt WEAVE} converts {\tt WEB} source to
{\TeX} input, from which {\TeX} can produce high-quality typeset
documentation of the program.


{\tt WEB} is a complex tool.
In addition to enabling programmers to present pieces of a program in
any order, it expands three kinds of macros, prettyprints code,
evaluates some constant expressions,
provides an integer representation for string literals, and implements
a simple form of version control.
The manual for the original version documents 27 ``control sequences''~\cite{knuth:web}.
The versions for languages other than Pascal offer slightly different
functions and different sets of control sequences.
Significant effort is required to make {\tt WEB} usable with a new
programming language, even when using a tool designed for that
purpose~\cite{ramsey:building}. 

{\tt WEB}'s shortcomings make it difficult to explore the {\em idea}
of literate programming; too much effort is required to master the
{\em tool}.
I designed a new tool that is both
simple and independent of the target programming language.
{\tt noweb} is designed 
around one idea: writing named chunks of code in any order, with
interleaved documentation. 
Like {\tt WEB}, and like all literate-programming tools, it can
be used to write a program in pieces and to present those pieces in
an order that helps explain the program.
{\tt noweb}'s value lies in its simplicity, which shows that the idea
of literate programming does not require the complexity of {\tt WEB}.

\section{{\tt noweb}} % , a minimal literate-programming system}
A {\tt noweb} file contains program source code interleaved with documentation.
When {\tt notangle} is given a {\tt noweb} file, it writes the program
 on standard output. 
When {\tt noweave} is given a {\tt noweb} file, it reads the {\tt
noweb} source and produces, on standard output, {\TeX} source for
typeset documentation.
Figure~\ref{transforms} shows how to use {\tt notangle} and {\tt
noweave} to produce code and documentation for a C~program contained
in the {\tt noweb} file {\tt foo.nw}.

\label{transforms}
\end{figure}

A {\tt noweb} file is a sequence of {\em chunks}, which may appear in any order.
A chunk may contain code or documentation.
Documentation chunks begin with a line that starts with an at sign ({\tt @})
followed by a space or newline.
They have no names.
Code chunks begin with
\begin{quote} 
\tt <<{\it chunk name}>>=
\end{quote} 
on a line by itself.
The double left angle bracket ({\tt <<}) must be in the first column.
Chunks are terminated by the beginning of another chunk, or by end of file.
If the first line in the file does not mark the beginning of a
chunk, it is assumed to be the first line of a documentation chunk.

Documentation chunks contain text that is ignored by {\tt notangle}
and copied verbatim to standard output by
{\tt noweave} (except for quoted code).   
{\tt noweave} can work with {\LaTeX}, or it can use
% insert a reference to 
a {\TeX} macro package, supplied with {\tt noweb}, that defines
commands like \verb+\chapter+ and \verb+\section+.

Code chunks contain program source code and references to other code
chunks.  
Several code chunks may have the same name; {\tt notangle}
concatenates their definitions to produce a single chunk, just as
 {\tt TANGLE} does.
Code chunk definitions are like macro definitions;
{\tt notangle} extracts a program by expanding one chunk (by default
the chunk named \verb+<<*>>+).
The definition of that chunk contains references to other chunks,
which are themselves expanded, and so on.
{\tt notangle}'s output is readable; it preserves the indentation of expanded
chunks with respect to the chunks in which they appear.

Code may be quoted within documentation chunks by placing double
square brackets around it ({\tt [[...]]}). 
These double square brackets are ignored by {\tt notangle}, but they
are used by {\tt noweave} to give code special typographic
treatment.

If double left and right angle brackets are not paired, they are
treated as literal ``{\tt<<}'' and ``{\tt>>}''.  Users can force any
such brackets, even paired brackets, to be treated as literal by
preceding the brackets by an at sign (e.g.~``{\tt @<<}'').

Figure~\ref{sample-input} shows a fragment of a {\tt noweb} program
that computes prime numbers.
The program is derived from the example used in
Reference~\refno{knuth:literate:book}, Chapter~4, and Figure~\ref{sample-input} should
be compared with Figure~2b of that paper.
Figure~\ref{noweave-output} shows the program after processing by {\tt
noweave} and {\LaTeX}.
Figure~\ref{notangle-output} shows the beginning of the program as
extracted by {\tt notangle}.
A complete example program accompanies this paper.

\section{Using {\tt noweb}}% experience with noweb?

Experimenting with \verb+noweb+ is easy.
{\tt noweb} has little syntax: definition and use of code chunks, marking of
documentation chunks, quoting of code, and quoting of brackets.
\verb+noweb+ can be used with any programming language, and its 
manual fits on two pages. 

\begin{figure}
\begin{verbatim}
program print_primes(output);
  const m = 1000;
        rr = 50;
        cc = 4;
        ww = 10;
        ord_max = 30;  { p_ord_max squared must exceed p_m }
  var p: array [1..m] of integer;
            { the first m prime numbers, in increasing order }
      page_number: integer;
\end{verbatim}
\unskip
\hbox{\hskip2em\tt\vdots}
\caption{Part of primes program as written by {\tt notangle}}
\label{notangle-output}
\end{figure}


On a large project, it is essential that compilers and other tools be
able to refer to locations in the \verb+noweb+ source, even though
they work with \verb+notangle+'s output~\cite{ramsey:literate}.
Giving \verb+notangle+ the  \verb+-L+ option makes it emit pragmas
that inform compilers of the placement of lines
in the \verb+noweb+ source.
It also preserves the columns in which
tokens appear.
If \verb+notangle+ is not given the \verb+-L+ option, it respects the
indentation of its input, making its output easy to read.
Large programs may also benefit from cross-reference information.
If given the \verb+-x+ option, {\tt noweave} uses {\LaTeX}
to show on what pages each chunk is defined and used.


{\tt WEB} files map one to one with to both programs and documents.
The mapping of \verb+noweb+ files to programs is many to many; the
mapping of files to documents is many to one.
Source files are combined by listing their names on \verb+notangle+'s
or \verb+noweave+'s command line.
Many programs may be extracted from one source by specifying the names
of different root chunks, using \verb+notangle+'s \verb+-R+ command-line
option.

%\clearpage % fixes bad break
The simplest example of a one-to-many mapping of programs is that of putting
C~header and program in a single {\tt noweb} file.
The header comes from the root chunk \LA{}header\RA{}, and the program
from the default root chunk, \LA{}*\RA{}.
The following rules for {\tt make} automate the process:%
\footnote{Using \verb+cmp+ avoids touching the header file when its contents
haven't changed.
This trick is explained on pages 265--266 of Reference~\refno{kernighan:unix}.}
\begin{verbatim}
foo.c: foo.nw
        notangle -L foo.nw > foo.c
foo.h: foo.nw
        notangle -Rheader foo.nw > xfoo.h
        -cmp -s xfoo.h foo.h || cp xfoo.h foo.h
\end{verbatim}
A more interesting example is using {\tt noweb} to
interleave different languages in one source file. 
I wrote an \verb+awk+
script that read a machine description and emitted a disassembler for
that machine, and I used {\tt noweb} to combine the script and description
in a single file, so I could place each part of the input next to the
code that processed that input. 
The machine description was in the root chunk \LA{}opcodes
table\RA{}, and the \verb+awk+ script in the default root chunk.
The processing steps were:
{\par\advance\hsize by 2in % avoid complaints about overfull box in verbatim
\begin{verbatim}
notangle opcodes.nw > opcodes.awk
notangle -R'opcode table' opcodes.nw | 
awk -f opcodes.awk > disassem.sml
\end{verbatim}
}

Many-to-one mapping of source to program can be used to obtain
effects similar to those of Ada or Modula-3 generics.
Figure~\ref{generic-example} shows generic C code that supports lists.
The code can be
``instantiated'' by combining it with another \verb+noweb+ file.
\verb+pair_list.nw+, shown in Figure~\ref{pair-list-example}, specifies
 lists of integer pairs.
The two are combined by applying \verb+notangle+ to them both:
\begin{verbatim}
notangle pair_list.nw generic_list.nw > pair_list.c
\end{verbatim} 
{\tt noweb} has no parameter mechanism, so the ``generic'' code must
refer to a fixed set of symbols, and it cannot be checked for errors
except by compiling \verb+pair_list.c+.
These restrictions make {\tt noweb} a poor approximation to real
generics, but useful nevertheless.

\begin{figure}
\begindocs{0}
This list code supports circularly-linked lists represented by a
pointer to the last element.  It is intended to be combined with other
{\tt noweb} code that defines \LA{}fields of a list element\RA{} (the fields
found in an element of a list) and that uses \LA{}list
declarations\RA{} and \LA{}list definitions\RA.

  struct list *_link;

    return right;

I have used \verb+noweb+ for small programs written in various
languages, including C, Icon, \verb+awk+, and Modula-3.
Larger projects have included a code generator for 
Standard ML of New Jersey (written in Standard ML) and 
a multi-architecture debugger, written in Modula-3, C, and
assembly language.
A colleague used \verb+noweb+ to write an experimental file
system in C++.

\section{Representation of {\tt noweb} files}

The \verb+noweb+ syntax is easy to read, write, and edit, but it is
not easily manipulated by programs.
To make it easy to extend \verb+noweb+, I have written
\verb+markup+, which converts \verb+noweb+ source to 
 a representation that is easily manipulated
by commonly used Unix tools like {\tt sed} and {\tt awk}.
In this representation,
every line begins with {\tt @} and a key word.
The possibilities are:
\begin{quote}
\leavevmode\rlap{\begin{tabular}{ll}
\tt @begin {\it kind} $n$&Start a chunk\\
\tt @end {\it kind} $n$&End a chunk\\
\tt @text {\it string}&{\it string} appeared in a chunk\\
\tt @nl&A newline\\
\tt @defn {\it name}&The code chunk named {\it name} is being defined\\
\tt @use {\it name}&A reference to code chunk named {\it name}\\
\tt @quote&Start of quoted code in a documentation chunk\\
\tt @endquote&End of quoted code in a documentation chunk\\
\tt @file {\it filename}&Name of the file from which the chunks came\\
\tt @literal {\it text}&{\tt noweave} copies {\it text} to output\\
\end{tabular}}
\end{quote}
{\tt markup} numbers each chunk, starting at~0.
It also recognizes and undoes the escape sequence for double brackets,
e.g.~converting ``{\tt @<<}'' to ``{\tt <<}''.
{\tt markup}'s output represents a sequence of files.
Each file is represented by a ``{\tt @file~{\it filename}}'' line,
followed by a sequence of chunks.

The representation of a documentation chunk is
\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\tt @begin docs $n$&where $n$ is the chunk number.\\
{\it docline}&repeated an arbitrary number of times.\\
\tt @end docs $n$
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}
where {\it docline} may be {\tt @text}, {\tt @nl}, {\tt @quote}, or
{\tt @endquote}.
Every {\tt @nl} corresponds to a newline in the original file.
{\tt markup} guarantees that quotes are balanced and not nested.

\vskip0pt plus12pt\penalty-200\vskip0pt plus-12pt
The representation of a code chunk is
\begin{quote}
\leavevmode\rlap{\begin{tabular}{ll}
\tt @begin code $n$&where $n$ is the chunk number.\\
\tt @defn {\it name}&name of this chunk.\\
\tt @nl&The newline following {\tt <<{\it name}>>=} in the original file\\
{\it codeline}&repeated an arbitrary number of times.\\
\tt @end code $n$
\end{tabular}}
\end{quote}
where {\it codeline} may be {\tt @text}, {\tt @nl}, or {\tt @use}.

The \verb+noweb+ tools are implemented by piping the output of
\verb+markup+ to other programs.
\verb+notangle+ is a Unix shell script that builds a
pipeline between \verb+markup+ and \verb+nt+, which reads
and expands definitions of code chunks.
\verb+noweave+ pipes the output of \verb+markup+ to a 24-line
\verb+awk+~script that inserts appropriate {\TeX} or {\LaTeX}
formatting commands.

Having a format easily read by programs makes {\tt noweb} extensible;
one can manipulate literate programs using Unix shell scripts and
filters.
To be able to share programs with colleagues who don't enjoy literate
programming, I modified \verb+notangle+ by adding to its pipeline a
stage that
places each line of documentation in a comment and moves it to
the succeeding code chunk.  The resulting script, \verb+nountangle+,
transforms a literate 
program into a traditional commented program, without loss of
information and with only a modest penalty in readability.
Figure~\ref{nountangle-output} shows the results of applying
\verb+nountangle+ to the prime-number program shown in
Figure~\ref{sample-input}. 
\verb+noweave+'s cross-reference generation is also implemented as an
extension; the output of \verb+markup+ is piped through an \verb+awk+
script that uses \verb+@literal+ to insert {\LaTeX} cross-reference
commands.
Another simple tool finds all the roots in a {\tt noweb} file, making
it easy to find definitions where chunk names have been misspelled.

\section{Comparing {\tt WEB} and {\tt noweb}}

Unlike {\tt WEB},
\verb+noweb+ is independent of the target programming language.
{\tt WEB} tools can be generated for many programming languages, 
but those languages must be lexically similar to C.
For example, {\tt WEB} can't handle the \verb+awk+ regular-expression
notation ``\verb+/+\ldots\verb+/+''; every such expression must quoted
using {\tt WEB}'s ``verbatim'' control sequence.
The effort required to 
generate {\tt WEB} tools is significant; the prospective user must
write a specification of several hundred 
lines.

Being independent of the target programming language makes {\tt noweb}
simpler, but it also means that {\tt noweb} can do less.
Most of the differences between {\tt WEB} and {\tt noweb} arise
because {\tt WEB} has language-dependent features that are not present
in \verb+noweb+.
These features include 
prettyprinting, 
typesetting comments using {\TeX},
generating an index of identifiers, 
expanding macros, 
evaluating constant expressions, 
and 
converting string literals to indices into a ``string pool.''
Among these features, 
\verb+noweb+ users are most likely to miss prettyprinting and the
index of identifiers. 


Some differences arise because {\tt WEB} and \verb+noweb+ implement
similar features differently. 
{\tt WEB}'s  original {\tt TANGLE} removed white space and folded
lines to fill each line with tokens,
making its output unreadable~\cite[Chapter~4, Figure~3]{knuth:literate:book}.
Later adaptations preserved line breaks but removed other white space.
By default, \verb+notangle+ preserves whitespace and maintains
indentation when expanding chunks.
It can therefore be used with
languages like Miranda and
Haskell, in which indentation is significant.
{\tt TANGLE} cannot.

{\tt WEB}'s {\tt WEAVE} assigns a number to each chunk, and its cross-reference
information refers to chunk numbers, not page numbers.
\verb+noweb+ uses {\LaTeX} to emit cross-reference information that
refers to page numbers.
Anyone who has read a large literate program will
appreciate the difference.

{\tt WEB} works poorly with \LaTeX; \LaTeX\ constructs cannot
be used in {\tt WEB} source, and getting {\tt WEAVE} output
to work in \LaTeX\ documents requires tedious adjustments by hand.
\verb+noweb+ works with both plain {\TeX} and {\LaTeX}.
Both {\tt WEAVE} and {\tt noweave} depend on the text formatter in two
ways: the source of the program itself, and the supporting macros.
{\tt WEAVE}'s source (written using {\tt WEB} for C) is
several thousand lines long, and the formatting code is not isolated.
{\tt noweave}'s source is a 57-line shell script, and only 31 of those
lines have to do with formatting.
Both 
{\tt WEAVE} and {\tt noweave} use about 200 lines of supporting macros
for plain {\TeX}.
\verb+noweb+ uses another 80 lines to support {\LaTeX}, most of which
is used to eliminate duplicate page numbers in cross-reference lists.

{\tt noweb} has
two features that weren't in the original {\tt WEB}, but that appeared in
some of {\tt WEB}'s later adaptations.
They are the ability to inform the compiler of the original locations
of source lines and the ability to extract more than one program from
a single source file.

Reviewers have had many expectations of literate-programming
tools~\cite{thimbleby:review,cvw:assessment}.
The most important is {\em verisimilitude}: a single
input should produce both compilable program and publishable document,
warranting the correctness of the document.
Others include flexible order of elaboration,
ability to develop program and documentation concurrently in one
place, cross-references, and indexing.
{\tt WEB} satisfies all these expectations, and {\tt noweb} satisfies
all but one (it does not provide automatic indexing). 

\section{Discussion}



{\tt WEB} takes the monolithic approach to literate programming---it
does everything.
{\tt noweb}'s approach is to compose
simple tools that manipulate files in the {\tt noweb} format. 
Existing Unix tools provide some of the {\tt WEB} features that
aren't found in \verb+noweb+.
Unix supplies two macro processors: the C
preprocessor and the \verb+m4+ macro processor.
\verb+xstr+ extracts string literals.
\verb+patch+ provides a form of version control similar to {\tt WEB}'s
change files.
Few of {\tt WEB}'s remaining features will be missed; for example, many compilers
evaluate constant expressions at compile time.
Experience with {\tt WEB} has suggested that prettyprinting may be
more trouble than it is worth, and that the index of identifiers,
while useful, is not a necessity~\cite{ramsey:literate}.

Three things distinguish {\tt noweb} from previous work.
{\tt noweb} takes as simple as possible a view of literate programming
and the tools needed to implement it. 
Instead of relying on a generator or re-implementation to support
different programming languages, {\tt noweb} is independent of the
target programming language.
{\tt noweave}'s dependence on its typesetter is small and isolated,
instead of being distributed throughout a large implementation.

Experimenting with {\tt noweb} is easy because the tools are simple
and they work with any language.
If the experiment is unsatisfying, it is easy to abandon, because 
\verb+notangle+'s output, unlike {\tt TANGLE}'s, is readable.
\verb+noweb+ is simpler than {\tt WEB} and is easier to use and
understand, but it does less.
I argue, however, that the benefit of {\tt WEB}'s extra features is
outweighed by cost of the extra complexity,
making \verb+noweb+  better for writing literate programs.

\verb+noweb+ can be obtained by 
anonymous {\tt ftp} from  {\tt
princeton.edu}, in file {\tt pub/noweb.shar.Z}.
